The implemented algorithm is designed in an offline-learning manner, that means that models of normal trajectories are learned offline beforehand and are not updated with new upcoming data on an on-going basis. The future researches can include investigating an opportunity of updating normal trajectories database in order to make the framework more adaptable to actual traffic data.
